#### Journey Log...because, science:
1. How does React work? How does the data flow?
2. Managing state and passing callbacks and data between parent-child components, and up from child/parent to sibling
3. es6 & React
4. es6 classes and stateless functional components
5. Testing with Jest, Enzyme, Sinon: unit and integration testing
6. Toolchain: Webpack, Yarn, Standard & eslint, Babel, npm
7. Familiar the docs (rtfm), stack overflows, blogs
8. Helper libs: shortid (generate random id), React immutability helper and need for immutable data
9. es6 classes vs createClass()
10. props and prop validation
